<h1>Wheelchair With Special Requirements Project</h1>

<p>The objective of this project was to learn how to design a wheelchair with special 
   requirements targeting certain type of users.
   The project was so helpful since it helped improve many skills and knowledge in 
   using CAD software as well as learning how to create successful plans to achieve 
   the desired results and requirements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the wheelchair was designed to have a reversed motion by implementing 
   planetary gear system that helps increase the torque to make the propulsion easier
   and smoother.</p>
<p>This wheelchair was designed for users with only one functional arm and one 
   functional leg.</p>
