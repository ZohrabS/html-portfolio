<h1>Thermoelectric Generator Challenge Project</h1>

<p>The objective of this project was to analyze the functionality of thermoelectric 
   generator on a small car. The car was designed to operate using the thermoelectric
   generator. The thermoelectric generator is powered based on the difference in 
   temperature, meaning that as the difference in temperature becomes higher the 
   voltage increases generating more power to operate the motor of the vehicle. 
   A candle was used to add heat on one of the surfaces of the thermoelectric 
   generator, while ice was used as a cold source on the other side.</p>
