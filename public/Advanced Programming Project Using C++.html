<h1>Advanced Programming Project Using C++</h1>

<h3>The objective of this project was to simulate a 4-stroke engine for the Capstone project.</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Generating the main concepts and expressions/functions of the PVTS class, which is the class that generates the PV and TS diagrams of the Otto Cycle.</li>
    <li>Prepared some formulas and functions for the other classes (like the ENGINE and INTER) to make sure everything is compatible with each other.</li>
    <li>My colleagues and I worked on finding and generating the algorithms needed, like the movement of the piston.</li>
    <li>Finding the right timing for the valves and spark with the help of my colleagues.</li>
    <li>Implemented some important functions and codes in the main function.</li>
    <li>Added a sound effect for the combustion using memory buffer to store the data from the sound file and play the sound from the buffer (because it is faster).</li>
</ol>
